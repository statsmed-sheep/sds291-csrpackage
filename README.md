# Exploring a model between sleep and BMI, with mediation by worry frequency

Clara Li, Rose Porta, and Shirley Zhang

The purpose of our study is to analyze the relationship between sleep and maintenence of a healthy weight and the influence of anxiety as a potential confounder of this relationship. A cross-sectional analysis of data (2018, n = 19,861) sourced from the IPUMS National Health Interview Survey was performed by fitting a multiple regression model using sleep and anxiety as predictors of BMI. Sleep was found to have a significant negative relationship with BMI (p < 0.05), while anxiety frequency and the interaction between anxiety and sleep fell short of the significance threshold (p > 0.05). We also fit a logistic regression model using the same predictors, with a binary response variable indicating obesity (BMI >= 30) or not. Using this model, all three predictors yielded significant p-values (< 0.05).Our findings corroborate the current literature on sleep and weight; despite not being significant in the linear model, the small p-values for anxiety frequency and its interaction with sleep nevertheless also suggest further research into both variables as predictors of BMI is warranted.
